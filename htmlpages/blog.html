  	      The term technology comes from the two Greek words <i>‘techne’</i> meaning art or craft and <i>‘logos’</i> meaning word or speech. This term first appeared in English in 17th Century, which was used in the discussion of applied arts. Now this term is used to describe advancements and changes which affect the environment around us. <br><br>
          If we think back to the start of technology, it dates to roughly 3 million years ago with the invention of stone tools during the stone age. After that came the agricultural age with its invention of agricultural tools used for farming and domestication of animals. Eventually, we saw the advancements in architecture, medicine, and early mechanical devices. <br><br>
          During the Middle Ages the technological advancements continued but at a much slower pace. During this period innovations included windmills, <b>the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg</b>, and advancements in shipbuilding. With its evolution over time, now technology is used in almost every step of life with the innovations such as electricity, automobiles, airplanes, telephone, radio, television, computers, and the internet. It is not showing any signs of slowing down, which can be seen from the work in the fields like artificial intelligence, renewable energy technologies, biotechnology, space exploration, nanotechnology, and in robotics and automation.

         <p style="padding: 30px;"><big>
          The advancement of technology has improved the lives of people and made it more comfortable and easier over the ages. If we look around us, we are surrounded by technology. It is in our homes and personal spaces, in industry, in business, and even in the medical fields.  This has made many positive as well as negative impacts. <br><br>
          One of the many examples of technology which is Internet has made the access of information very swift, easy, and provides instant access to vast amounts of knowledge all over the world.  It has vastly improved the productivity of the people in every fields. With the advancement of technology, people can now communicate face to face with each other from one corner of the world to another in mere seconds.
          Transportation has also developed at a rapid pace. In the early centuries, travelling from one place to another was time consuming and inefficient. People had to use animals such as horses as means of transportation. Now, travelling has become cheaper, faster, and more comfortable. The advancements in medical technology have improved healthcare services by making it more precise, accessible, and patient centered. Technology has also given unlimited sources of entertainment to the people.<br><br>
          Along with the positive aspects of the technology comes its negative aspects. Every information, be it personal or in business, is stored online. Even the secured private information on the internet is vulnerable to the hackers and can be wrongly used by them for their own needs.  People have been addicted to the online world and tend to waste most of their time away from the reality. This has led to the increase in mental health problems.  With the development of machines, the jobs previously done by humans are being replaced by the machines which is leading to shortage of jobs and unemployment.<br><br>
          In short, technology has brought numerous benefits as well as some negative effects. We must find the right balance between these aspects of technology for the humanity to flourish.

          <p style="padding: 30px;"><big>
           Technology has revolutionized the business by increasing its efficiency, connectivity, productivity, and innovation. The use of internet has allowed businesses to collect vast amounts of data providing valuable insights into consumer behaviour and ongoing market trends to fulfil the people’s needs and gain profit. Online marketplaces have enabled businesses to reach international markets and expand their customer base globally. The printing industry has also significantly thrived from the new technological advancements.<br><br>
           Prior to Johannes Gutenberg introducing the printing press during the 1440s, there had been a couple of options to reproduce images or any type of literature which were not very practical as they were expensive and time consuming. The invention of the printing press by Gutenberg has proved to be a far more efficient and more affordable way to print and has marked the beginning of the modern-day printing era. This idea has been taken as a base to build many other modern era printers like Laser printer, Inkjet printer, and so on.<br><br>
           Nowadays, digital printing has assumed a significant role in every printing business, and the conventional methods of printing have become out of date. The new technology has paved the way for Digital Printing which has evolved the printing businesses and has allowed them to reach their maximum potential by making the printing process more affordable, faster, and better than before. By reducing errors and enhancing overall efficiency, it has reduced the unnecessary wastage of resources. The availability of this has now given small businesses, startups, and even individuals the ability to produce professional looking printed materials without the need for significant upfront investments. Technology has also introduced 3D printing, also known as addictive manufacturing which is used to create three dimensional objects layer by layer from digital models.
